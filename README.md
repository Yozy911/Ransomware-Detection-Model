# Ransomware-Detection-Model
Machine learning based detection framework to detect ransomware on windows OS. This repository does not
include the cuckoo sandbox API that is purposed for submitting a sample to cuckoo sandbox for dynamic 
analysis and retreiving a json report. Rather, the samples tested were manually submitted to cuckoo 
and the json reports were retrieved which are the seed that the framework works with. The user interface
is implemented using streamlit (refer to 'https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation' to 
ensure all dependancies are up-to-date).
